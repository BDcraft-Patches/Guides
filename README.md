<!-- ABOUT -->
## About BDCraft
[![BDCraft Logos](./images/bdcraft_logoMain.png "BDCraft")](https://bdcraft.net)

For about a decade now, [Sphax](https://twitter.com/sphax84) has been creating the [BDCraft](https://bdcraft.net) family of unique and high quality resource packs for Minecraft. BDCraft's flagship pack, [PureBDCraft](https://bdcraft.net/downloads/purebdcraft-minecraft/), turns Minecraft into a vibrant, comic book style world, with new interpretations of mobs and items to fit the comic inspired style. [VanillaBDCraft](https://bdcraft.net/downloads/vanillabdcraft-minecraft/) uses the same styles as Pure, but stays true to the original colors and designs found in Minecraft's default resource pack. [GrungeBDCraft](https://bdcraft.net/downloads/grungebdcraft-minecraft/) gives Pure's vibrant world a grungy, semi-realistic twist. Where PureBDcraft is cartoony, clean, and smooth, GrungeBDcraft is semi-realistic, noisy, and dirty.

All of these packs are available for download for use in Minecraft Java edition [here](https://bdcraft.net/downloads/). Our packs are also available for Minecraft Bedrock through the official Minecraft Marketplace!

We also make skin packs, addons, and have a pretty awesome forum--all of which can be found on [BDCraft.net](https://bdcraft.net).
